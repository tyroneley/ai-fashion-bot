Generate a CAD-style technical sketch for an elegant, streamlined long-sleeve midi-dress, featuring a sleek column silhouette crafted from a fine matte crepe. Present the garment in front, side, and back views, emphasizing a minimalist aesthetic with a hidden front placket and subtle, clean-finished architectural cuffs.

Utilize precise, varying line weights – thicker for the garment outlines, medium for internal construction details like strategically placed princess seams, and fine single-needle lines for all stitching. The sketch should be monochrome grayscale, with critical patternmaking annotations (e.g., HPS, CF, CB, hemlines, grainlines) highlighted in red, and specific measurements (e.g., Neck Drop: 3", Hem Allowance: 2", Sleeve Length: 24") in blue for clarity.
 --output_format: CAD-style technical line drawing; monochrome or single-color palette; high-contrast line art; include front/side/back views; numbered annotations for seams and measurements; no photographic textures; focus on construction and pattern clarity.
