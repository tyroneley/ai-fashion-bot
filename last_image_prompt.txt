Generate a CAD-style technical sketch for an elegant, structured sheath dress, emphasizing precision and clean lines. The garment features a defined, tailored silhouette with precise princess seams extending from the armhole to a natural waistline, where subtle shaping darts radiate. A sharp, architectural stand collar and crisp, set-in sleeves contribute to its refined structure, suggesting a high-quality material like worsted wool gabardine or heavyweight silk faille.

Render clear front, side, and back views using varied line weights: heavy for the main garment outline (0.8pt), medium for all seams (0.4pt), and fine for internal details and annotations (0.2pt). Utilize minimal 0.1cm single-needle topstitching solely on the collar edge for definition, ensuring all other seams are invisibly clean-finished. Include essential annotations for a patternmaker, such as collar height, center back length, exact waist position, and recommended hem allowance (e.g., 5cm), all presented monochromatically in charcoal grey on a crisp white background.
